People’s ways of getting to work in Chelsea have changed drastically between the 1970s and today, and one of the most striking ways that change can be seen is in comparing walking-commute data for southern Chelsea. This side-by-side slider map shows how the percentage of working adults commuting by walking changed between 1970 and 1990:

And this map shows how it changed between 1990 and today:

Notice some of the specific changes that have occurred in southern census tracts of Chelsea. In tract 1603, by the water on the southeastern side, the percentage of people walking to work dropped from 73% to 0% of the population, though the total number of working people in that tract increased. Between 1990 and today, the central tract 1604 went from having a significantly larger number of walking people than its neighbors (25%, represented by the much darker red shading) to having only 3% of its population walking to work, though again, the population overall increased. 

The modern site [“walkscore”](<https://www.walkscore.com/MA/Chelsea>) gives Chelsea a fairly high walkability rating at 81/100. This score is [calculated](<https://www.walkscore.com/methodology.shtml>) by measuring the distance to various amenities, and thus how many daily errands would require a car. Despite this high rating, however, most Chelsea residents are not accomplishing their daily commutes by walking.

Why do we see such a large drop in walking data for these two periods, creating a Chelsea today where very few people walk to work? There are many environmental factors that shape people’s commutes, and historical factors have changed the way people get around in Chelsea between 1960 and today. We will explore a few historical and environmental factors that may be impacting pedestrian data below. 

### HISTORY: The Chelsea Naval Hospital

The Chelsea Naval Hospital dominated the land of census tract 1603 (the tract we saw drop from 73% walking to 0%) until the year 1973. This hospital was a major employer of people in the area as well: employment data from 1970 reveals that 94% of tract 1603 residents over the age of 16 were employed in the armed forces.

Many images and maps of the Chelsea Naval Hospital exist, but few images exist of the land after the decommissioning of the hospital in 1973. After this decommissioning, the land was [described](<https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/server/api/core/bitstreams/35bc096c-dcf8-47d7-88e6-4de6f0270641/content>) as a “decadent and blighted open area” furthering the problem of “substantial and persistent unemployment” and “economic dislocation” in the area. Indeed, in 1990, we see that though the total working population has actually increased since 1970, the number of people walking to work has dropped to zero in tandem with the number of people employed in the armed forces dropping to zero. People who were once employed at the hospital had to look elsewhere for employment, and whatever employment they found was apparently inaccessible or inconvenient through walking. 

### EMPLOYMENT: Commuting In and Out of Chelsea

Census data collected by the US government shows how many people commute into, out of, and within Chelsea year by year. The map below shows a visualization of commute data from 2021:

For this year, only 1,960 people are recorded as both living and working in Chelsea, which provides an approximate number of people who might have the ability to walk to work. Chelsea residents who commute out of Chelsea likely have to take cars or public transit. Social Explorer states that 978 people in Chelsea actually did commute by walking in 2021, about 5% of the population: 

<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://www.socialexplorer.com/c84a04d4ed/embed" width="800" height="600" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>


This is a little less than half of 1,960, so the rest of those living and working in Chelsea are commuting some other way than the sidewalks. However, we see that a large factor in limiting the number of people walking to work today is the distance they have to commute. 

### TRANSIT: Chelsea and the MBTA

One necessary aspect of a walkable area is access to public transportation. If people can easily walk to train and bus stops for longer commutes, they are less car-dependent overall and may walk more frequently. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s reach into Chelsea is thus a defining feature of walking in the city. 

The red, green, blue, and orange lines do not extend into Chelsea. For a while, the only major public transit option in Chelsea was the commuter rail, which had a single Chelsea stop, primarily providing a route in and out of Chelsea. The 2013 map below is part of a study that shows the issue of public transit access in Chelsea and which recommended an extension of the Silver Line into Chelsea.

The commuter rail stop being a center of public transit in Chelsea, however, may help explain why the area in which it’s located - census tract 1604 in the maps above - remained a more walking-heavy area for longer. People who could walk to a train station had more access and motivation to walk instead of relying on cars to commute. 

Today, the issue of lack of public transit in Chelsea is being addressed. Chelsea has been [incorporated](<https://www.chelseama.gov/archives/mbta_info.php>) into several MBTA bus lines, and it is also served by the Silver Line. SL3 now extends into Chelsea via a bus route, and will [soon be expanded](<https://mass.streetsblog.org/2024/03/08/mbta-endorses-a-new-bus-rapid-transit-route-through-everett>) to run through Chelsea into Everett.

### HISTORY: Highway Construction

Chelsea was further bisected by the construction of US Route 1, which is now a major feature of the landscape. Comparing a Chelsea map from 1914 to one today, you can see how the highway appears in places where there used to be parks and dense residential streets. Once again, these forms of transportation prioritize providing convenient routes for getting into and out of Chelsea.

### PEDESTRIAN SAFETY: Downtown Crash Data

The safety of downtown streets and sidewalks can be a consideration for whether commuters decide to walk, drive, or take public transit to work. The Massachusetts Department of Transportation recently studied the safety of cars, bikes, and pedestrians in downtown Chelsea (close to Route 1) to see if they could improve traffic and pedestrian experience. The map below shows “crash clusters” indicating how many crashes and injuries occurred between 2008 and 2017. The data showed some of the lowest pedestrian safety in the commonwealth.

MassDOT suggested immediate improvements to safety in Chelsea could include a dedicated bike/bus lane around this area, as well as creating more spacious bus stop waiting areas.
