# Walking in Chelsea: 1970 to Today

People’s ways of getting to work in Chelsea have changed drastically between the 1970s and today, and one of the most striking ways that change can be seen is in comparing walking-commute data for southern Chelsea. This side-by-side slider map shows how the percentage of working adults commuting by walking changed between 1970 and 1990:

Notice some of the specific changes that have occurred in southern census tracts of Chelsea. In tract 1603, by the water on the southeastern side, the percentage of people walking to work dropped from 73% to 0% of the population, though the total number of working people in that tract increased. Between 1990 and today, the central tract 1604 went from having a significantly larger number of walking people than its neighbors (25%, represented by the much darker red shading) to having only 3% of its population walking to work, though again, the population overall increased. 

The modern site [“walkscore”](<https://www.walkscore.com/MA/Chelsea>) gives Chelsea a fairly high walkability rating at 81/100. This score is [calculated](<https://www.walkscore.com/methodology.shtml.) by measuring the distance to various amenities, and thus how many daily errands would require a car. Despite this high rating, however, most Chelsea residents are not accomplishing their daily commutes by walking.

Why do we see such a large drop in walking data for these two periods, creating a Chelsea today where very few people walk to work? There are many environmental factors that shape people’s commutes, and historical factors have changed the way people get around in Chelsea between 1960 and today. We will explore a few historical and environmental factors that may be impacting pedestrian data below. 

### HISTORY: The Chelsea Naval Hospital

The Chelsea Naval Hospital dominated the land of census tract 1603 (the tract we saw drop from 73% walking to 0%) until the year 1973. This hospital was a major employer of people in the area as well: employment data from 1970 reveals that 94% of tract 1603 residents over the age of 16 were employed in the armed forces.

Many images and maps of the Chelsea Naval Hospital exist, but few images exist of the land after the decommissioning of the hospital in 1973. After this decommissioning, the land was described as a “decadent and blighted open area” furthering the problem of “substantial and persistent unemployment” and “economic dislocation” in the area ([source](https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/server/api/core/bitstreams/35bc096c-dcf8-47d7-88e6-4de6f0270641/content)). Indeed, in 1990, we see that though the total working population has actually increased since 1970, the number of people walking to work has dropped to zero in tandem with the number of people employed in the armed forces dropping to zero. People who were once employed at the hospital had to look elsewhere for employment, and whatever employment they found was apparently inaccessible or inconvenient through walking. 

### EMPLOYMENT: Commuting In and Out of Chelsea

Census data collected by the US government shows how many people commute into, out of, and within Chelsea year by year. The map below shows a visualization of commute data from 2021:

For this year, only 1,960 people are recorded as both living and working in Chelsea, which provides an approximate number of people who might have the ability to walk to work. Chelsea residents who commute out of Chelsea likely have to take cars or public transit. Social Explorer states that 978 people in Chelsea actually did commute by walking in 2021, about 5% of the population:

This is a little less than half of 1,960, so the rest of those living and working in Chelsea are commuting some other way than the sidewalks. However, we see that a large factor in limiting the number of people walking to work today is the distance they have to commute.
