Chelsea’s streetscape has been influenced by a number of factors throughout its history, including growing industrial and military space around Boston, the dawn of highway construction, and two devastating fires that destroyed huge residential sections of the city. The built environment of Chelsea is demonstrated in maps and photographs in our collections, but it also impacts everyday people, impacting how they choose to move around town - driving, taking public transit, biking, or walking. 

### HIGHWAYS AND RAILROADS

The city of Chelsea was first chartered in 1857, ten years before the map above was created via surveys. As the map shows, Chelsea was already divided by major streets and a railroad; in fact, the Grand Junction Railroad received a charter to run through Chelsea, connecting two parts of Boston, [eight years before](<https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.burningofchelsea00pratt/?sp=17&st=pdf&r=-0.33%2C-0.083%2C1.66%2C1.66%2C0&pdfPage=22>) the city received its own charter. This provided Chelsea’s residents with greater connection to the city over the river, but sometimes at the expense of their own urban space. 

The Turnpike Map of Massachusetts comes from several decades later in 2005, after highway construction transformed many cityscapes in the latter twentieth century. Chelsea was further bisected by the construction of US Route 1, which is now a major feature of the landscape. Comparing a Chelsea map from 1914 to one today, you can see how the highway appears in places where there used to be parks and dense residential streets. Once again, these forms of transportation prioritize providing convenient routes for getting into and out of Chelsea. 

For a long time, however, Chelsea has not been reliably served by the MBTA. The red, green, blue, and orange lines don’t extend into Chelsea; Chelsea is served by only one commuter rail stop as well as [seven bus lines](<https://www.chelseama.gov/archives/mbta_info.php>). One of the busiest centers of bus transit in downtown Chelsea lies right next to a section of Route 1; the map below shows how five key bus routes run beside or pass across the highway’s space.

The 2013 map below is part of a study that shows the issue of public transit access in Chelsea and which recommended an extension of the Silver Line into Chelsea. SL3 now extends into Chelsea via a bus route, and will [soon be expanded](<https://mass.streetsblog.org/2024/03/08/mbta-endorses-a-new-bus-rapid-transit-route-through-everett>) to run through Chelsea into Everett.

### MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL SPACE

Our 1857 map also shows the beginning of how Chelsea’s waterfront would be constructed: as a primarily military and industrial space. At the top right, we see the grounds for the Chelsea Naval Hospital, ceded to the federal government in 1828 (once again before Chelsea had received a city charter). Here we see a plan of the fully-constructed marine hospital from 1857:

From nearly a century later in 1941, we see an aerial photograph of the hospital:
