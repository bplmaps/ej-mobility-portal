Chelsea’s streetscape has been influenced by a number of factors throughout its history, including growing industrial and military space around Boston, the dawn of highway construction, and two devastating fires that destroyed huge residential sections of the city. The built environment of Chelsea is demonstrated in maps and photographs in our collections, but it also impacts everyday people, impacting how they choose to move around town - driving, taking public transit, biking, or walking. 

### HIGHWAYS AND RAILROADS

The city of Chelsea was first chartered in 1857, ten years before the map above was created via surveys. As the map shows, Chelsea was already divided by major streets and a railroad; in fact, the Grand Junction Railroad received a charter to run through Chelsea, connecting two parts of Boston, [eight years before](<https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.burningofchelsea00pratt/?sp=17&st=pdf&r=-0.33%2C-0.083%2C1.66%2C1.66%2C0&pdfPage=22>) the city received its own charter. This provided Chelsea’s residents with greater connection to the city over the river, but sometimes at the expense of their own urban space. 

The Turnpike Map of Massachusetts comes from several decades later in 2005, after highway construction transformed many cityscapes in the latter twentieth century. Chelsea was further bisected by the construction of US Route 1, which is now a major feature of the landscape. Comparing a Chelsea map from 1914 to one today, you can see how the highway appears in places where there used to be parks and dense residential streets. Once again, these forms of transportation prioritize providing convenient routes for getting into and out of Chelsea. 

For a long time, however, Chelsea has not been reliably served by the MBTA. The red, green, blue, and orange lines don’t extend into Chelsea; Chelsea is served by only one commuter rail stop as well as [seven bus lines](<https://www.chelseama.gov/archives/mbta_info.php>). One of the busiest centers of bus transit in downtown Chelsea lies right next to a section of Route 1; the map below shows how five key bus routes run beside or pass across the highway’s space.

The 2013 map below is part of a study that shows the issue of public transit access in Chelsea and which recommended an extension of the Silver Line into Chelsea. SL3 now extends into Chelsea via a bus route, and will [soon be expanded](<https://mass.streetsblog.org/2024/03/08/mbta-endorses-a-new-bus-rapid-transit-route-through-everett>) to run through Chelsea into Everett.

### MILITARY AND INDUSTRIAL SPACE

Our 1857 map also shows the beginning of how Chelsea’s waterfront would be constructed: as a primarily military and industrial space. At the top right, we see the grounds for the Chelsea Naval Hospital, ceded to the federal government in 1828 (once again before Chelsea had received a city charter). Here we see a plan of the fully-constructed marine hospital from 1857:

From nearly a century later in 1941, we see an aerial photograph of the hospital:

This naval hospital is substantially set apart from the residential Chelsea landscape, taking up more land than any other single property in the city. It remained a major aspect of southern Chelsea for over a century before it was decommissioned in 1973. In 1980, the abandoned site was [declared](<https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/server/api/core/bitstreams/35bc096c-dcf8-47d7-88e6-4de6f0270641/content>) to be a “decadent and blighted open area” furthering the problem of “substantial and persistent unemployment” and “economic dislocation” in the area. Eventually the area became a [government land bank](<https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/server/api/core/bitstreams/21742e90-a5fe-43f9-95ba-c4c2afc264b9/content>), and then a [park](<https://archives.lib.state.ma.us/server/api/core/bitstreams/9e62827c-c326-4762-9f88-be544fd5c64c/content>), and a [larger population returned](<https://www.socialexplorer.com/d32448e3e7/explore>) to the area. Still, the former military space has meaningfully defined the Chelsea waterfront in various ways ever since its construction. 

The Chelsea waterfront has also been dominated by large industries, especially shipping and energy. The 1892 map below shows how the waterfront is crowded with lumber and coal wharves:

By 1965, other industries had arrived: this plan of a new produce center by the waterfront also displays how oil refineries had begun crowding into the space.

Photographs taken in subsequent decades show how tank farms now take up waterfront space among the shipyards, something also visible in the aerial view of the naval hospital shown above:

Chelsea’s history of large industrial and military space has impacted its population, causing a larger number of working-class and low-income communities to settle there. [One writer remarked](<https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.burningofchelsea00pratt/?sp=17&st=pdf&r=-0.33%2C-0.083%2C1.66%2C1.66%2C0&pdfPage=22>) on the increase in working-class people and immigrants in Chelsea prior to 1908, drawn there for work. Today almost a quarter of Chelsea’s residents live below the poverty line, and almost two-thirds identify as Hispanic or Latino; these demographic elements of Chelsea put it at a [higher level of risk](<https://www.wbur.org/news/2017/07/26/environmental-justice-boston-chelsea>) for instances of environmental injustice. This map from WBUR shows the larger concentration of “environmental justice populations” in the Chelsea area, as compared with the rest of Boston and Massachusetts.

### FIRE

The city of Chelsea has a devastating history with fires, having suffered one in 1908 and a second in 1973, both destroying large residential areas. Atlas maps of Chelsea show how much of the city is constructed of “frame buildings” rather than of brick or stone, making them more vulnerable to fire.

The 1908 fire tore through a large portion of the city, starting on one end at the waterfront but piercing deep into Chelsea’s residential buildings. [One commentator predicted](<https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.burningofchelsea00pratt/?sp=17&st=pdf&r=-0.33%2C-0.083%2C1.66%2C1.66%2C0&pdfPage=22>) that Chelsea would “never again… be the residential city that it was fifty years ago”, both because of the fire’s destruction and due to the ever-increasing presence of industry, which, along with the railroads and highways, would dominate Chelsea’s landscape far more than residential streets and homes. 

In 1973, the same year the Chelsea Naval Hospital was decommissioned, leaving a “blighted and open area” behind, another fire led to even greater challenges for the Chelsea streetscape.
